# Introduction

This course is designed to give you hands-on, practical learning so you can understand the fundamentals of Kubernetes and Docker, not just in theory, but by actually doing.

## Why Killercoda?

Killercoda provides an interactive playground where you don’t need to install anything on your own machine. Everything runs inside a live environment in your browser. That means:
- No need to configure Docker or Kubernetes locally
- You get a fresh environment every time
- Mistakes are safe—just restart the scenario
- You can focus purely on learning by doing

## How the learning will work

Each topic comes with a short explanation
You’ll immediately apply it in the terminal provided by Killercoda
You’ll see real output, just like in production environments
At the end, there will be a quiz or challenge to reinforce the knowledge

## Setup in General

Nothing to install: everything is pre-provisioned for you
You’ll have access to:
